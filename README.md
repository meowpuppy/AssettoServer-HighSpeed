## About HighSpeed.gg

[HighSpeed.gg](https://highspeed.gg) is a community-driven Assetto Corsa server that specializes in high-energy freeroam and cut up sessions. The server uses this special build to deliver the most authentic and enjoyable cut up traffic experience available in Assetto Corsa.

## What does "Cut Up" mean?

"Cut up" refers to the driving style of weaving and maneuvering through traffic at speed, threading the needle between AI and real drivers, much like viral street runs seen online. This server is purpose-built for that style—expect challenging, dynamic traffic and wide-open roads.
